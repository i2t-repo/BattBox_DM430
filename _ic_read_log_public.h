/*
 * The design decision to define the Buffer member
 * of the read log handler as a plain array or
 * pointer make it necessary to have a set of handler
 * struct types that match the type of its buffer.
 * Another approach would have been to design the
 * struct so that the generic members became separated
 * from the type of the buffer. This could be done by
 * putting the Buffer member in an union or by defining
 * a struct to contain the common members.
 *
 * The implementation is coded in a way that is not
 * in fully compliance with the C standard. This was
 * done to simplify the implementation. It is believed
 * that all compilers in existence generate code that
 * work as intended.
 *
 * The implementation expects that a set of structs
 * with a common initial sequence can be cast to
 * each other and still give access to the common
 * members. The C99 standard only guarantees this
 * for structs that are members of a common union.
 *
 * From 6.5.2.3#5 in the C99 standard:
 * "if a union contains several structures that share a
 * common initial sequence, and if the union object
 * currently contains one of these structures, it is
 * permitted to inspect the common initial part of any
 * of them anywhere that a declaration of the complete
 * type of the union is visible."
